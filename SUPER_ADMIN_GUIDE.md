**Whitelabel Admin (test5.localhost:3000/admin/[businessId]):**
- Manages THEIR whitelabel only

- Their users and businesses

## Revenue Model

### Platform Fees (What YOU Earn)
Each whitelabel pays you:
1. **Platform Fee Percentage**: X% of every booking
2. **Monthly Subscription**: ¬£X/month

These are configured in the Branding tab of each whitelabel's admin portal.

### Example
- Whitelabel "SalonPro" has:
  - Platform fee: 1%
  - Monthly subscription: ¬£200
  - Monthly bookings: ¬£10,000

**YOUR Revenue from SalonPro:**
- Platform fees: ¬£100 (1% of ¬£10,000)
- Subscription: ¬£200
- **Total: ¬£300/month**

## Next Steps

1. Add super admin role verification
2. Implement approval workflow for new whitelabels
3. Add detailed analytics charts
4. Add global platform settings
5. Add user management across all platforms
6. Add email notifications for new signups
