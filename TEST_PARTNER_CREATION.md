### Step 2: Check Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) and terminal to see:

```
Creating Clerk user for: test@test.com
Clerk user created: user_xxxxx

OR (if Clerk fails):

Error creating Clerk user: [error details]
Using temporary Clerk ID: temp_xxxxx
Sending welcome email via Brevo to: test@test.com
Email sent successfully via Brevo: msg_xxxxx
```

---

### Step 3: Check Email Inbox

**If Clerk worked:**
- Look for email from: "Clerk" or "GlamBooking"
- Subject: "You've been invited to join GlamBooking"
- Click link â†’ Set password

**If Brevo sent email:**
- Look for email from: "GlamBooking"
- Subject: "ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Test Beauty - Your Platform is Ready!"
- Click "Login to Dashboard" button
- Create account via Clerk sign-up

---

### Step 4: Set Up Hosts File

```
# Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
# Mac/Linux: /etc/hosts

Add this line:
127.0.0.1 testbeauty.localhost
```

---

### Step 5: Login

**Visit:**
```
http://testbeauty.localhost:3000/sign-in
```

**If you got Clerk invitation:**
- Use email + password you set

**If you got Brevo email:**
- Click "Sign up" first
- Create account with same email
- Then login

---

### Step 6: Access Dashboard

After login, visit:
```
http://testbeauty.localhost:3000/business/dashboard
```

**You should see:**
- âœ… Custom colors (pink/gold)
- âœ… "Test Beauty" branding
- âœ… Your business dashboard
- âœ… Can add services, staff, etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Email Received

**Check 1: Console Logs**
```
Terminal logs should show:
"Email sent successfully via Brevo: msg_xxxxx"

If not, check:
- BREVO_API_KEY is set in .env.local
- API key is valid
- Email address is valid
```

**Check 2: Spam Folder**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Add noreply@glambooking.co.uk to contacts

**Check 3: Brevo Dashboard**
```
Visit: https://app.brevo.com
Login â†’ Campaigns â†’ Transactional
See if email was sent
```

### Clerk User Not Created

**This is OK!** System has fallback:
- Creates temp user in database
- Sends email via Brevo instead
- Partner can still sign up manually

**To manually create Clerk user:**
```
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Users â†’ Create user
3. Enter email: test@test.com
4. Name: Test Owner
5. Send invitation
```

### Can't Login

**Check:**
1. User exists in Clerk dashboard
2. Email is verified
3. Password is set
4. Business exists in database

**Reset:**
```sql
-- Check if user exists
SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email = 'test@test.com';

-- Check if business exists
SELECT * FROM "Business" WHERE email = 'test@test.com';

-- Check white-label config
SELECT * FROM "WhiteLabelConfig" WHERE subdomain = 'testbeauty';
```

### Dashboard Shows "Business Not Found"

**Fix:**
```
1. Check user.clerkId matches Clerk user ID
2. Check business.ownerId matches user.id
3. Restart dev server
4. Clear browser cache
```

## Manual Workaround (If All Fails)

### If emails don't work at all:

1. **Create partner in admin** (as normal)

2. **Get login details from response:**
   ```json
   {
     "loginUrl": "http://testbeauty.localhost:3000/sign-in",
     "invitation": {
       "sent": false,
       "email": "test@test.com"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Manually create Clerk user:**
   - Go to Clerk dashboard
   - Create user with email
   - Send invitation

4. **Or: Partner signs up manually:**
   - Visit: `http://testbeauty.localhost:3000/sign-up`
   - Create account with same email
   - System links to business automatically
